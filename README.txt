# RoomDbTask

A brief description of your Android project.

## Overview

This Android app is designed to [provide a specific functionality]. It follows the MVVM architecture pattern, utilizes Room for local data storage, Retrofit for API calls, and Glide for efficient image loading.

## Architecture

The project follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, which separates the application into three main components:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application. In this project, the `Room` database is used to store and manage local data, and `Retrofit` is used to make API calls.

- **View**: Represents the UI components. XML layouts define the UI, and `Activity` and `Fragment` classes handle the UI interactions.

- **ViewModel**: Acts as a mediator between the Model and the View. `ViewModel` classes contain the business logic and handle the communication between the UI and the data layer.

## Design Patterns

The project incorporates the following design patterns:

- **Repository Pattern**: Manages the flow of data between the API and the local database. The `Repository` class handles data retrieval and provides a clean API to the rest of the application.

- **ViewHolder Pattern**: Implemented in RecyclerView adapters to efficiently recycle and reuse views.

## Libraries Used

- **AndroidX Libraries**: Utilized for various Android components, including `ViewModel`, `LiveData`, and `Fragment`.

- **Room**: Used for local data storage, providing an abstraction layer over SQLite.

- **Retrofit**: A type-safe HTTP client for making API calls. It simplifies network communication and data parsing.

- **Glide**: A fast and efficient image loading library for Android.
